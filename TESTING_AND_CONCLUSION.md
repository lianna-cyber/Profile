# Final Testing and Conclusion

## Functionality Testing

Implementing a website into the internet can be quite a challenge, especially for a first attempt. GitHub Pages presented minor issues that can be improved over time, such as uploading necessary files to the repository, setting up specific workflows for respective file types, and waiting for the builder to complete. Once configured, the website runs with expected functionality—webpage connections are solid and redirections are instant.

**Key Testing Results:**
- Debugging is straightforward since GitHub Pages parameters can be adjusted for accessibility and functionality issues
- Multi-user simultaneous access test: Multiple incognito browsers opened the website at the same time to test server capacity
- **Outcome:** Slight latency was present when redirecting between webpages, but overall performance is comparable to standard websites on the internet

## Recommendation for Future Work

While GitHub Pages provided a functional hosting solution, future projects should consider upgrading to a proper domain with fully customizable hosting for greater flexibility and reliability.

**Recommended Alternative:**
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** offers superior hosting capabilities with over 200 fully featured services from global data centers
- AWS enables businesses to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster
- Features include advanced build, deployment, and enhancement tools that maximize website potential
- Provides failsafe mechanisms for unforeseen events and customizable parameters

This approach would significantly improve upon GitHub Pages' limitations and provide enterprise-level scalability.

## Conclusion

Building and hosting a website involves multiple interconnected skills—coding, design, and selecting the right hosting platform. This project demonstrated that:

- **Web Development:** Integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files into a cohesive design is both challenging and rewarding
- **Professional Value:** Successfully building and hosting a website adds considerable value to a professional portfolio
- **Hosting Selection:** Choosing the right webhost service is critical for business operations, user experience, and cost management
- **Industry Relevance:** Web-building and webhosting are essential skills for a sustainable, future-proof career in tech

Cloud services have become mainstream in web design, and mastering these tools—whether through self-teaching or professional guidance—is necessary for success in the modern web industry.
